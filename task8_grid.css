/*DESCODIFICADAS TRILHA SEMANA 10 - GRID*/

/* The grid div is the grid container, and all the direct child elements are the grid items. When we defined the grid tracks with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, grid provided us numbered lines called the grid lines to use for positioning the items. You can refer to each grid line by a numerical index. */
/* Columns start at one, from left to right by default, and rows also begin at one from top to bottom. It takes two grid lines to make a single column or row, one line on either side, so our 8-column and 8-row grid consist of
9-column lines and 9-row lines.

The vertical lines 1 and 2 determine the start and end points of the first column. Lines 2 and 3 the second column and so on. Similarly, horizontal lines 1 and 2 determine the position of the first row, and lines 2 and 3 the second row and so on. Knowing the above concepts will help you understand how we are going to position items (images) on our grid. */

Note: The object fit property only works if we set the width and height properties. */
